# Welcome to SnapFlash 👋

This is a minimalist, AI-powered flashcard app designed to help you build your English-Vietnamese vocabulary decks instantly with just a snap. 

## Workflow of the Flashcard Creation Process

1. **Capture:** The user takes a photo of any physical English text.
2. **Extract:** The app uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan the image and extract the text into discrete words.
3. **Cross-Reference:** The system checks the extracted words against an integrated English-Vietnamese dictionary to identify valid vocabulary.
4. **Auto-Fill:** The app automatically fetches the translations and definitions from the dictionary to pre-populate the flashcards.
5. **Review & Edit:** The user reviews the generated list, selects the specific words they want to learn, and can manually edit or update the flashcard details before saving them to their deck.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
